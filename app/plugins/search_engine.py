"""Simple module designed to provide searching funcionalities for confidant app.

POC:
    The searching algorithm takes into account the "meta-data" of a diary record
    and it could be described as follows:

    1. Extract a score out of every diary record
        1.1 Count the number of occurancies of the keyword in the title
        1.2 Count the number of occurancies of the keyword in the content
        1.3 Add those numbers but give more weight to the title
    2. Create an ordered list of the most relevant diaries
        2.1 For a diary: the higher the score, the more relevant it is
        2.2 Ignore diaries with negative or zero score
        2.3 Sort the diaries list, most relevant first

Usage:
>>>     se = SearchEngine(list_of_diaries)
>>>     results = se.search(list_of_keywords)
>>>
>>>     # results will now contain an ordered list of most relevant diaries
